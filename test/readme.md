OpenTable front-end test
========================

Thanks for taking the time to complete our front-end test.  Please aim to spend between two and three hours on this application.

## The task

Build a basic application from which two users can select their dishes from a supplied dinner menu, and are shown the total cost.

The application must use only HTML, CSS and JavaScript (frameworks are allowed) and be built with high quality, maintainable code that is covered by test cases.

The menu application must use the following dishes and adhere to the restaurant's rules.

### The menu

#### Starters
- Soup of the day £3
- Pâté £5
- Bruschetta £4.50
- Prawn cocktail £6

#### Main course
- Steak £18
- Meatballs £11.50
- Salmon fillet £14
- Vegetarian lasagna £12

#### Desserts
- Sticky toffee pudding £4
- Tiramisu £4.50
- Cheesecake £4
- Ice cream £3.50


### Rules

This restaurant unfortunately has a number of rules about the meals that can be ordered.

- Each person must have at least two courses, one of which must be a main.
- Each diner cannot have more than one of the same course. 
- There is only one piece of cheesecake left.
- Pierre the snobby waiter will not let you have prawn cocktail and salmon fillet in the same meal.


## Acceptance criteria

- The total bill amount is displayed when at least one dish has been selected.
- An error message is displayed when I try to select an invalid menu combination.
