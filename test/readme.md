OpenTable front-end test
========================

Thanks for taking the time to complete our front-end test.  Please aim to spend no more than two hours on this application.

## The task

Build a basic application from which two users can select their dishes from a supplied dinner menu, and are shown the total cost.

The application must use only HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no server-side code) and be built with high quality, maintainable code that is covered by test cases.

The menu application must use the following dishes and adhere to the restaurant's rules.

### The menu

#### Starters
- Soup of the day £3
- Pâté £5
- Bruscetta £4.50
- Prawn cocktail £6

#### Main course
- Steak £18
- Meatballs £11.50
- Salmon fillet £14
- Vegetarian lasagna £12

#### Deserts
- Sticky toffee pudding £4
- Tiramisu £4.50
- Cheesecake £4
- Ice cream £3.50


### Rules

This restaurant unfortunately has a number of rules about the meals that can be ordered.

- Each person must have at least two courses, one of which must be a main.
- Each diner cannot have more than one of the same course. 
- There is only one piece of cheesecake left.
- Pierre the snobby waiter will not let you have prawn cocktail and salmon fillet in the same meal.


## Acceptance criteria

- The total bill amount is displayed when at least one dish has been selected.
- An error message is displayed when I try to select an invalid menu combination.
